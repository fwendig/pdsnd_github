### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Data is imported from <city>.csv file, which is determined by the user.
By interactive setting of filters by the user like month and day of week,  the program is able to answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics.
The interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics is accomplished by displaying rows of raw data to the user, if she/he likes to.

#### Following statistics are provided
**Statistics on the most frequent times of travel:**
* display the most common month
* display the most common day of week
* display the most common start hour

**Statistics on the most popular stations and trip:**
* display most commonly used start station
* display most commonly used end station
* display most frequent combination of start station and end station trip

**Statistics on the total and average trip duration:**
* display total travel time
* display mean travel time

**Statistics on bikeshare users:**
* display counts of user types
* display counts of gender
* display earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth

**Display raw data on user request.**
