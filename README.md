### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Data is imported from <city>.csv file, which is determined by the user.
By interactive setting of filters by the user like month and day of week,  the program is able to answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics.
The interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics is accomplished by displaying rows of raw data to the user, if she/he likes to.
